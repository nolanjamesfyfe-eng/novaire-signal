In theory manufacturers using it in plastics will not only use 30% less material, they will produce better stronger products that last longer sell for high prices and increase margin. They will in most cases use the same machinery they have and also increase output per factory shift by 20-30% or so, because of fast curing times.  \n\nThe ROI on this is absolutely massive.   And if you don’t use it soon nobody is gonna want your products cause they are considered cheap low quality in comparison.  Evolve or die",
