It stems from on our deep understanding of fractal graphene aggregates.  \n\nWe’ve patented it and we believe it’s gonna blow peoples minds :) \n\nFractal graphene aggregates are already the world’s most superior graphene in many applications.   We think we just made it even better. Huge for $hg $hgraf and huge for TurboStrata.",
