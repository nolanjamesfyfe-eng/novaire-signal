      "text": "Bullish oil bets are surging:\n\nBrent crude call option volumes surged to a record 5.8 million contracts in January.\n\nThis is followed by 3.5 million contracts so far in February, one of the highest readings on record, with one week of trading still remaining.\n\nBy comparison, the previous peak was 5.7 million in October 2024, which came amid tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\nThe current surge is driven by fears of a US strike on Iran, with President Trump considering military action after amassing the largest US force in the region since 2003.\n\nAs a result, the oil market is off to its strongest start to a year since 2022, with prices rising +15% YTD.\n\nOil market positioning has rarely been this bullish.",

      "text": "As the skeptics are likely to come attack with the shares moving up.  The point about capacity will be continually raised for $hg $hgraf\n\nIt’s cookie cutter.  Off the shelf components mostly.   As grok or other ai’s. Texas used to have huge acetylene capacity.  The Ai’s suggest that Texas could ramp up enough acetylene production for $hg to produce 100k tonnes of graphene per year over just 4-7 years.  100k tonnes would be $20 bln a year profit.  Capacity growth can meet explosive demand as it materializes",
