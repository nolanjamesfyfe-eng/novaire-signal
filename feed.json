      "text": "Iran is rushing to export oil amid surging tensions with the US:\n\nIranian crude exports jumped +200% MoM, to 20 million barrels between February 15-20.\n\nThis is equivalent to over 3 million barrels per day, far above Iran's usual daily exports.\n\nSatellite imagery confirms the spike, with tankers near Iranian ports more than doubling from 8 to 18 over the same period.\n\nThe same pattern was seen last year, when Iran rushed to ship crude shortly before American air strikes, and again in 2024 during elevated tensions.\n\nIran largely depends on oil revenue to keep its economy running and is loading as much crude as possible before any potential disruption.\n\nIran is preparing for volatility.",

      "text": "I would argue the opposite… Hydrograph is an Nanotech IP company that has been lost and unappreciated because it’s been marketing on the CSE amongst shitco miners.  \n\nThe audience is completely clueless to what Hydrograph $hg $hgraf is all about.   \n\nJaded investor group that doesn’t have a clue how to value it or if they should believe in it. So they have to wait for EPA approvals and other major milestones to see the forest through the trees. \n\nIt’s moving to the Nasdaq and is now marketing to a world that is desperate for nanomaterials and graphene tech. Especially high tech applications and advanced biotech \n\nVery few mining guys got it… only the curious deep dive types.   Jay was willing to look. Guys like Doug Casey and Jim Rogers have been on the hunt for a viable graphene solution for ages.  They get it.",
