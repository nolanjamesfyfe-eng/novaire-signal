A beautiful elegant natural crystallization of carbon to make perfect little fluffy carbon snow flakes.  \n\nUnderstands this truth will allow us to make the world a better place. \n\nBeing in the lab with Dr. Sorensen and scooping up a spoonful of fractal graphene and seeing it jiggle and wiggle with pure black weightless wonder can only be described as magical.",
