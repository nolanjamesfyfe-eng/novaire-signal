Shareholder of $hg $hgraf \nWe’ve talked about doing a podcast to discuss the energetic investor, graphene and investing / consciousness etc. \n\nThinking we should plan that soon.  I’ve been waiting for this EPA approval to be completed.  With this and the gas plant deal likely to be completed any day. Plus EU and UK approvals I am extremely excited to talk about $hg $hgraf and fractal graphene aggregates.  \n\nWill also have some updates soon on Turbostrata Inc. Have some exciting key partners joining the firm!  Many exciting patents to discuss. All that use $hg $hgraf graphene to make the world a better place!",

We know its cookie cutter to ramp up and major acetylene producer partnership is about to be announced.\n\nSo now it’s just a matter of pick your tonnage orders and pick a P/E\n\nWill USA DoW / USA military order 10k tonnes or could it be 20-30k tonnes in time.  \n\nWill customer orders be 10-20k or more tonnes in the next couple years. \n\nOnce the orders are confirmed the market (and brokers that will soon produce research coverage) will try to estimate the forward size of the order book. \n\n5000 tonnes per annum equals $1 bln which depending on pe could be 15 to 100x that in market cap.  \n\nThis is where the stock goes bonkers.  Cause surely people will begin pricing in 10-20-50k over the longer term horizon.  \n\nThis will result in market cap productions of $100b to 1/2 trillion.   In time me saying that it could be fastest company to 1 trillion from sub $100 mln won’t sound crazy. \n\nThe $20-30 bln market cap level isn’t hard to achieve in this crazy market.  The youth today gave $gme $37 bln. Which would be $100 share for $hgraf. \n\nThats why I think we will quickly see a ramp up to the $20-30 level this summer as we move to Nasdaq.  \n\nAs the major orders come in it runs for $80-100 the following year.  \n\nI’m really hopefully for the FDA approval of food grade plastics now that we have EPA.  Will also get this food grade designation in the UK and EU.  \n\nWhen that happens it will be crazy how much demand there will be.   It will be the top key ingredient in all food grade plastics.  \n\nThe consumer will not want to mess around with non-Hydrograph plastic when it comes to food packaging, home containers, or cooking/eating utensils.",
