My partners and I at Turbostata Inc believe we just had our Move 37 moment. \n\nWe have a novel graphene invention that is counter intuitive and revolutionary.  It stems from on our deep understanding of fractal graphene aggregates.  \n\nWe’ve patented it and we believe it’s gonna blow peoples minds :) \n\nFractal graphene aggregates are already the world’s most superior graphene in many applications.
