      "text": "\"I think anyone who does math or physics feels that he or she is discovering truth, not inventing things but discovering them.\"\n-Ed Witten\n\nFor my $hg $hgraf investing has come on a journey into exploring the essence of the material world. \n\nIt’s a key discovery of molecular science.  A beautiful elegant natural crystallization of carbon to make perfect little fluffy carbon snow flakes.  \n\nUnderstands this truth will allow us to make the world a better place. \n\nBeing in the lab with Dr. Sorensen and scooping up a spoonful of fractal graphene and seeing it jiggle and wiggle with pure black weightless wonder can only be described as magical.",

      "text": "Both the human brain and body, much like mycelial networks, dynamically sculpt their architecture through activity-dependent processes: high energy flow and usage reinforce and expand connections, pathways, and tissues, while low or absent activity triggers weakening, pruning, or regression—optimizing structure for efficiency and minimal metabolic waste in response to real-time demands.\n\nWe are a biological supercomputer that operates with a distributed network.  Our consciousness forms as a collaboration of cellular communication.",
