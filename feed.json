      "text": "A lot of people don’t understand the roi of working with $hg graphene.   In theory manufacturers using it in plastics will not only use 30% less material, they will produce better stronger products that last longer sell for high prices and increase margin. They will in most cases use the same machinery they have and also increase output per factory shift by 20-30% or so, because of fast curing times.  \n\nThe ROI on this is absolutely massive.   And if you don’t use it soon nobody is gonna want your products cause they are considered cheap low quality in comparison.  Evolve or die",

Shareholder of $hg $hgraf \nWe’ve talked about doing a podcast to discuss the energetic investor, graphene and investing / consciousness etc. \n\nThinking we should plan that soon.  I’ve been waiting for this EPA approval to be completed.  With this and the gas plant deal likely to be completed any day. Plus EU and UK approvals I am extremely excited to talk about $hg $hgraf and fractal graphene aggregates.  \n\nWill also have some updates soon on Turbostrata Inc. Have some exciting key partners joining the firm!  Many exciting patents to discuss. All that use $hg $hgraf graphene to make the world a better place!",
