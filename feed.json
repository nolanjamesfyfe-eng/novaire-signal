      "text": "I would argue the opposite… Hydrograph is an Nanotech IP company that has been lost and unappreciated because it’s been marketing on the CSE amongst shitco miners.  \n\nThe audience is completely clueless to what Hydrograph $hg $hgraf is all about.   \n\nJaded investor group that doesn’t have a clue how to value it or if they should believe in it. So they have to wait for EPA approvals and other major milestones to see the forest through the trees. \n\nIt’s moving to the Nasdaq and is now marketing to a world that is desperate for nanomaterials and graphene tech. Especially high tech applications and advanced biotech \n\nVery few mining guys got it… only the curious deep dive types.   Jay was willing to look. Guys like Doug Casey and Jim Rogers have been on the hunt for a viable graphene solution for ages.  They get it.",
