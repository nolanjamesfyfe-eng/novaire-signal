You can receive a ballot at a PO Box, but it cannot be the domicile address—which over 30 of them are, errors and suspected fraudulent activity is everywhere in California voter rolls.\n\nEven with obvious evidence California seems to not care about their voter rolls meanwhile you do not even need an ID to vote… how much fraud do you suspect in California?",
